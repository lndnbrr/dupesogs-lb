## Overview
Dupesogs is a web application developed by Frontend Software Developer, Landon Borrego, as his frontend capstone project. Designed to enhance vinyl record management for a global user base, the application aims to promote the hobby across generations. Utilizing ReactJS and NextJS for a component-driven, stateful frontend, and Firebase for real-time database operations and secure authentication, the application delivers an efficient and dynamic user experience. The current implementation fulfills all MVP requirements, with ongoing development focused on stretch goals and feature enhancements.
